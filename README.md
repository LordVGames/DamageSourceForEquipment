# DamageSourceForEquipment

When the SOTS phase 2 update dropped, Gearbox added another damage source option: Equipment. This could let items/character abilities do things depending on damage from specifically equipments, but Gearbox never actually implemented the damage source, rendering it practically useless. This mod actually implements it for all equipment that can do damage, including elite aspects (configurable).
